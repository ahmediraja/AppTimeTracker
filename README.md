This app tracks the usage of the currently active desktop applicaiton and the domain for the active Google Chrome tab.

Made for macOS.

To use this, make sure to 'pip install pyobjc'.

*The activities.json file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.*

This app just tracks the apps being used and for how long. I am planning on making an application that visually represents the usage down the line.
